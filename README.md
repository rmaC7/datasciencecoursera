The following README is included as part of a course requirement. 
The directory / repository will store course material. 

##Git Hub is Fun

Today (which was some time last week) I successfully downloaded README.md from GitHub repository using the Git Bash interface I'm revising this now in RStudio so let's see if I can save it in my 'repo' (see 'Repo Man' a 1984 American science fiction crime comedy film directed by Alex Cox - yes the one with sex in the back seat of the car). The paragraph was edited on my Linux 14.04 laptop.

Today, Tuesday, I successfully downloaded README.md from GitHub repository using the Git Bash interface. I am updating README.md from my Windows 8 laptop. 

I feel satisfaction because I resolved a conflict between these two versions of README. 

##Note 
* if you have two repositories going at once, make sure you pull from Git Hub before you edit a file that is also stored on a 2nd laptop. 
* Do the pull, open, edit, save, then commit, then push.
