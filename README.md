===================
The following README is included as part of a course requirement. 
The directory / repository will store course material. 

Today I successfully downloaded README.md from GitHub repository using the Git Bash 
interface using 'clone' (note I refer to 'clone' as the command that did the work but I executed a few others which may have done so, so my understanding is weak presently) - either way, I'm revising this now in RStudio so let's see if I can save it in my 'repository'. This was saved from my Linux laptop.
