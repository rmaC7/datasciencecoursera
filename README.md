===================
The following README is included as part of a course requirement. 
The directory / repository will store course material. 

Today I successfully downloaded README.md from GitHub repository using the Git Bash 
interface using 'clone' (note I refer to 'clone' as the command that did the work but I executed a few others which may have done so, so my understanding is weak presently) - either way, I'm revising this now in RStudio so let's see if I can save it in my 'repo' (a non word, if repo doesn't confuse you (with the suggestion of 'taking back' or 'repossession'), or suggest at a deep level of speech the term 'repossess' or 'repo man' (a 1984 American science fiction crime comedy film directed by Alex Cox) then you need more American culture in your life. 
Jargon, for me, is kitsch for the mind. Is jargon a symptom of the Twitter culture? Maybe the texting culture. I digr, sorr. I'll spea in four lett trun word for the rema of this docu so that I can fit bett into my clas ling mili ewe.
