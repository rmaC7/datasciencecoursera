===================
The following README is included as part of a course requirement. 
The directory / repository will store course material. 

Today I successfully downloaded README.md from GitHub repository using the Git Bash 
interface using 'clone' (note I refer to 'clone' as the command that did the work but I executed a few others which may have done so, so my understanding is weak presently) - either way, I'm revising this now in RStudio so let's see if I can save it in my 'repo' (a non word, in my opinion 'lazy' gibberish truncation of the more informative term 'repository') - if repo doesn't confuse you (with the suggestion of 'taking back' or 'repossession'), or suggest at a deep level of speech the term 'repossess' or 'repo man' (a 1984 American science fiction crime comedy film directed by Alex Cox) then you need more books in your life. 
I've never felt so insecure with my subject matter that I felt I had to speak in jingos and jargon. I'm glad about that part of my life - trying to get rid of exclusionist jargon.
Jargon, for me, is like kitsch for the mind. It pisses me off as a listener because it makes me feel like I don't know what is being said, when I know exactly what's being said, and the real problem is that the speaker or writer is too lazy to say or write all the syllables of the real (meaningful, easy) word. 
Is jargon a symptom of the Twitter culture? Maybe the texting culture. 
I digr, sorr. I'll spea in four lett trun word for the rema of this docu so that I can fit bett into my clas ling mili.
